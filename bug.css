The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.myClass div {
  color: red;
}

#myId div {
  color: green;
}

#myId .myClass div {
  color: purple;
}
```

The issue arises when trying to determine which style will be applied to the `div` element. The various selectors have different specificity levels, and the most specific selector will override the others.  Incorrect understanding of specificity could lead to unexpected visual results. This is a subtle error because it might not always be immediately apparent why a particular style is not being applied.
