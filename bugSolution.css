The solution involves a deeper understanding of CSS selector specificity.  To fix this, understand that IDs (#) have higher specificity than classes (.), and classes have higher specificity than element selectors (div). The order of declarations in the stylesheet does not affect the specificity. 

Here's how to avoid such errors:

1. Use a CSS specificity calculator to debug unexpected styling.
2. Use more specific selectors when necessary to override styles effectively.
3. Ensure the styles have the correct selector to get the proper output.
4. Avoid using overly general selectors unless intentionally targeting all elements.

```css
div {
  color: blue; /* Will be overridden by more specific selectors */
}

.myClass div {
  color: red; /* Will be overridden by the most specific selector */
}

#myId div {
  color: green; /* Will be overridden by the most specific selector */
}

#myId .myClass div {
  color: purple; /* This will be the applied style due to highest specificity */
}
```

In this corrected solution, the comments clarify how the specificity rules resolve the conflict, leading to the expected `purple` color for the target div.
